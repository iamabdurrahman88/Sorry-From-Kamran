    <p>
      I cannot even imagine the pain I brought 
      <br>to you with my harsh tone in today's 
      <br>fight. I wanted to come over to your place 
      <br>and beg for your forgiveness but was ashamed 
      <br>of myself. I am writing this letter to you to 
      <br>apologize for my behavior and tell you that I deeply 
      <br>regret my actions. You are a true blessing in my life, 
      <br>and I would hurt myself before letting anything 
      <br>happen to you. I promise to make you believe 
      <br>all this through actions, not words. Please allow 
      <br>me back into your life and be my world again.
